# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## 0.1.0 - 2018-10-02

### Added

The `openshift-install` command.  This moves us to the new
install-config approach with [asset
generation](docs/design/assetgeneration.md) in Go instead of in
Terraform.  Terraform is still used to push the assets out to
resources on the backing platform (AWS, libvirt, or OpenStack), but
that push happens in a single Terraform invocation instead of in
multiple steps.  This makes installation faster, because more
resources can be created in parallel.  `openshift-install` also
dispenses with the distribution tarball; all required assets except
for a `terraform` binary are distributed in the `openshift-install`
binary.

The configuration and command-line interface are quite different, so
previous `tectonic` users are encouraged to start from scratch when
getting acquainted with `openshift-install`.  AWS users should look
[here](README.md#quick-start).  Libvirt users should look
[here](docs/dev/libvirt-howto.md).  The new `openshift-install` also
includes an interactive configuration generator, so you can launch the
installer and follow along as it guides you through the process.

### Removed

The `tectonic` command and tarball distribution are gone.  Please use
the new `openshift-install` command instead.
